Binary Code
*Any data in 0s/1s format (images, text, etc.)*
→ Generic binary representation

Machine Code
Binary instructions executable by CPU
→ Subset of binary code that controls processor

Assembly Code
Human-readable mnemonics for machine code
→ Needs assembler conversion

Low-Level Code
Hardware-near code (machine/assembly)
→ Minimal abstraction

High-Level Code
Human-friendly code (Python/C++)
→ Requires compiler/interpreter

Source Code
Original human-written code
→ Input for compilers/assemblers

Object Code
Machine code output (unlinked)
→ Not directly executable

Byte Code
Portable intermediate code (Java/Python)
→ Runs on virtual machine

Key distinction:

Binary code = All 0s/1s data

Machine code = CPU-executable binary subset
